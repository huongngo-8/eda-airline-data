# Exploration of Operational Data from Airlines Pre and Post-COVID.

This project was created for the Statistics Directed Reading Program @ UW. In this project, financial and operational data of passenger airline carriers were explored to learn about how passenger airline carriers are operating post-COVID and any operational factors of the business that have changed due to lower passenger traffic. 

There will be more work done on this project to discover more interesting conclusions by improving on the methods used in the current iteration and including a supplementary data set (traffic-capacity). Moreover, the next work will also involve other multivariate exploratory methods such as Analysis of Repeated Measurements to characterize changes in response variables and determine any explanatory variables most associated with any change. 

Currently, the presentation of this project is available, but a full analysis report will be published soon with the above mentioned methods being applied.
